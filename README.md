# Heart_Disease_Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project

This project is about building a Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning with Python. 

Heart disease prediction using machine learning in Python involves building a predictive model that can analyze data related to a person's health (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, etc.) and predict the likelihood of that person developing heart disease in the future. This typically involves steps such as data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, training the model on the training data, evaluating its performance on the test data, and tuning the model for better accuracy. Various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks can be used for this purpose. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable model that can assist in early detection and prevention of heart disease.
